# Structure:

## Recurssion 
Read section 1.1 to 1.4 (inclusive)
Reference 1 - http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/01-recursion.pdf. 
This will cover:
* Introduction to recurssion
* Simple recursion problem
* Tower of Hanoi 
* Merge sort

* We can delve further into it as per your interest

## Greedy Algorithms
Reference 3: http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/04-greedy.pdf
This deals with interesting problems like:
* Job scheduling
* Huffman Codes

## Graph problems:
Reference 4: http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/05-graphs.pdf
We will go through basic graph traversal and graph distance algos.
